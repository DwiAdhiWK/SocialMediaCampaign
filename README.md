## Business Problem
This Power BI dashboard performs a complete **funnel analysis** of paid social media campaigns across **TikTok**, **Instagram**, and **Facebook**.  
The main goal is to understand how effectively different campaign types convert impressions → reach → engagement → clicks, identify the most cost-efficient platforms & strategies, and provide actionable recommendations to **maximize clicks while minimizing cost per acquisition**.

## Key Feature
- Impression vs Reach comparison across campaigns
- Engagement vs Clicks breakdown
- Campaign distribution by platform
- Detailed conversion rates (Engagement Rate & CTR) per platform & campaign type
- Budget efficiency metrics (CPM, CPC, Cost per Engagement)

## Key Business Questions Answered
1. How do **Impressions** and **Reach** compare across different campaign types?
2. Which campaigns drive the highest **Engagement** and **Clicks**?
3. How are campaigns distributed across **TikTok**, **Instagram**, and **Facebook**?
4. What are the **Engagement Rate** and **CTR** (Click-Through Rate) per platform & campaign?
5. Which platform and campaign type deliver the **lowest Cost Per Click (CPC)** and best ROI?

## Insight and Discoveries
- **Product Launch** campaigns dominate in scale:  
  → Highest Impressions (**1.057M**) and Reach (**535K**)  
  → Highest Engagement (**54,383** interactions)

- **Awareness** campaigns surprisingly drive the **highest number of clicks** overall (**7,856**)

- - Platform specialization is clear:  
  → **TikTok** → mainly **Product Launch** (7 campaigns) — strong for awareness & scale  
  → **Instagram** → focuses on **Promo Month** (6 campaigns) — good for engagement  
  → **Facebook** → more balanced distribution, highest overall **Engagement Rate** (**0.08%**)

- **Engagement Rates** (paid campaigns):  
  - Facebook: **0.08%** (best performer, especially Brand Collaboration at **0.10%**)  
  - Instagram: **0.07%** (Brand Collaboration leads at **0.11%**)  
  - TikTok: **0.06%** (Promo Month highest at **0.08%**)  
  → These rates are reasonable for paid social in 2025–2026 — organic content usually performs much higher.
  
- **Cost Efficiency** highlights:
  - overall **average CPC(Click Per Cost)** is **$0.351**
  - **Cheapest CPC** on **TikTok Awareness** ($0.234) and **Instagram Awareness** ($0.117)  
  - **Facebook** is most expensive (**$0.450** average), especially for Product Launch Boost
  - **TikTok** shows the best **Cost per Engagement** in many cases (e.g. Product Launch at **$0.028**)
    
## Business Recommendations

1. **Shift more budget toward Awareness-style campaigns**  
   They deliver the **highest absolute number of clicks** at significantly lower **CPC** (especially on Instagram & TikTok). Consider using them as top-of-funnel traffic drivers.

2. **Prioritize TikTok for Product Launches**  
   It delivers massive scale (impressions & reach) at the lowest **CPM** (~$2–4 in many cases) and very competitive cost per engagement. Double down here for new product introductions.

3. **Use Brand Collaboration & Promo Month on Instagram**  
   These show the **highest engagement rates** (up to **0.11%**) — ideal for building community interaction and mid-funnel nurturing.

4. **Re-evaluate heavy spending on Facebook Engagement Boost**  
   High **CPC** ($0.608) and relatively low efficiency compared to other platforms. Reduce or retarget only for very specific older demographics if needed.

5. **Test hybrid strategy: TikTok for scale → Instagram for engagement → Facebook for retargeting**  
   Build a full-funnel approach using each platform's strength to improve overall ROI and lower blended CPC.
